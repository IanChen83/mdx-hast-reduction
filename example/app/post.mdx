> Markdown for the component era.

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your Markdown documents.
You can import components, like interactive charts or notifs, and export metadata.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast :rocket:.

See it in action

```jsx
import { Chart } from '../components/chart'

# Here's a chart

The chart is rendered inside our MDX document.

<Chart />
```

__:heart: Powerful__: MDX blends Markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in React/JSX-based projects.

__:computer: Everything is a component__: Use existing components inside your MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.

__:wrench: Customizable__: Decide which component is rendered for each Markdown element (`{ h1: MyHeading }`).

__:books: Markdown-based__: The simplicity and elegance of Markdown remains, you interleave JSX only when you want to.

__:fire: Blazingly blazing fast__: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage.

and weaving interactive components in with existing markdown.”

## Why?

Before MDX, some of the benefits of writing Markdown were lost when integrating with JSX.
Implementations were often template string-based which required lots of escaping and cumbersome syntax.

MDX seeks to make writing with Markdown _and_ JSX simpler while being more expressive.
The possibilities are endless when you combine components (that can even be dynamic or load data) with the simplicity of Markdown for long-form content.
